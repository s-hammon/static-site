# Tolkien Fan Club

**I like Tolkien**. Read my [first post here](/majesty)

> All that is gold does not glitter

## Reasons I like Tolkien

* You can spend years studying the legendarium and still not understand its depths
* It can be enjoyed by children and adults alike
* Disney *didn't ruin it*
* It created an entirely new genre of fantasy

## My favorite characters (in order)

1. Aragorn
2. Sam
3. ThÃ©oden
4. Gandalf
5. Faramir

999. ~~Gollum~~ Wormtail

Here's what `elflang` looks like (the perfect coding language):

```
func main(){
    fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
